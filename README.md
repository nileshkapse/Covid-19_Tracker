# Covid-19_Tracker using python
Develop an application that performs digital tracking of covid19 patients to follow-up on their health status and enables hospitals and governments to effectively and efficiently keep track of patients.  The COVID Tracking Project is a collaborative volunteer-run effort to track the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in India. It maintains a regularly updated database of a variety of types of government-level, state-level information related to the outbreak, including counts of the number of positive and negative test results obtained in each state, hospitalization and outcome data for cases, and the racial and ethnic demographic breakdowns of cases and deaths.
